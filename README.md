How do you approach designing software?
Designing a software system is an important skill for software developers. It involves planning and structuring complex systems to meet specific requirements, ensuring scalability, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. It is vital to create robust and adaptable systems that can handle real-world demands and future growth. Below are steps I will take to designing a software system:

•	Define the problem -  understanding the requirements, goals, and constraints of the system
•	Requirements gathering and planning – information is gathered, analyzed, and documented. Teams collaborate on what needs to be done.
•	Creating a design – a detailed blueprint of the requirement is created
•	Implementation – code is written based on the design needs
•	Testing –  test is conducted to ensure they meet requirements and quality standards.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Using OpenGL has given me the opportunity to create both 2D and 3D visualizations by manipulating texture, vertices, and shaders.  This experience  strength my understandings of graphic concepts for example, how to organize the rendering operation and coordinate transformation to achieve realistic visual effects. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process followed a structured sequence to ensure clarity and efficacy as described below:
•	First, I reviewed the module resources., to familiarize myself with the project expectation
•	Then, I downloaded the CS330Content ZIP file and extract the contents to the C drive on my  system. 
•	Once I understand the content, I begin the assignment by opening the Visual Studio solution (SLN) file. 
•	Then the Visual Studio application automatically launched. 
•	I made sure to use the 2022 version of Visual Studio. 
•	Then I build and run the project. 
•	I then created code to address the required functionality. 
•	I then ensured that the code met the required functionality and visual representation outlined for the assignment. 
•	My approach involved iterative development, writing small portions of the code, running test, debugging, and refining until the functionality and appearance were satisfactory.
•	I made sure to apply proper logical structuring  and  correct syntax to code. 
•	I followed best practices by applying proper formatting standards and comprehensive commenting to make the code readable and maintainable.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
In the future, the tactic of breaking the code down in little parts building it up slowly will help me to create codes where it is easy to identify and fix errors by building and running the code frequently after every block of code. This approach will help me maintain  high quality of work and reduce development time.
How do you approach developing programs?
Here is how I approach developing a program:
•	Create requirement specification.
•	Prepare project plan.
•	Design user experience and user interface.
•	Architect the software.
•	Code the solution.
•	Establish integrations.
•	Run rigorous testing.
•	Deploy program.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new development strategy that I used while working on the 3D scene was, UV mapping and texturing. In this strategy the 3D model surface was unwrapped into a flat 2D plane to accurately apply texture. By assigning the UV coordinate textures can be  projected onto the complex 3D shape correctly without distortion and stretching. I used Physically Based Rendering  (PBR) textures to ensure materials react to light realistically.
How did iteration factor into your development?
It allowed me to build and improve my scene incrementally. Which allowed me to adjust slowly to lighting, textures, and shapes. This enabled me to catch mistakes early in code development.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Completing each milestone contributed to my patience and testing abilities. With each milestone I was able to move one step further into the final project.  This resulted in me being attentive and not rush the code development process. I learned that it is better to put a little code at a time to prevent errors.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will help me to reach my goal of becoming a software engineer by developing my problem-solving skills which is done through critical thinking. It taught me the importance of  being adaptable, learning new technology, and methodology. This is important to be established  in the field for a long term.
10.How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualization gave me new knowledge and skill such as: making the data easier to understand, by improving my comprehension of complex systems.

For this project I took a photo of a lemon tree in a flowerpot,  placed on a grassy patch with a lantern and a garden shovel nearby. This scene will allow me to show basic  3D shapes.  The trunk of the tree will be modeled as a cylinder, lemons as a sphere, the canopy as  a cone,  flowerpot as a tapered cylinder. The dirt and grass are modeled as a plane. The lantern will be  shown as a  rectangular box, the garden shovel combines two different shapes cylinder for the handle and prism for the blade.

I choose these objects because they will demonstrate how we can combine  basic shapes into different forms to create recognizable forms. The approach I followed made it less complex to achieve the requirements. I incorporate forms with minimal complexity which made the work achievable.

Summary Table (for clarity)

Object	Basic 3D Shapes	Explanation
Lemon Tree	Sphere, cylinder, cone	Thre tree trunk can be a cylinder for the height, the lemons as a sphere for their rounded appearance and the canopy as a cone for its peak and spread base.
Flower Pot	Tapered cylinder	The flower pot with the sloping sides will be best captured as  a tapered cylinder.
Grass	Plane	A flat plane will serve as the ground and on it the grass blades will be represented by coloring it green.
Dirt	Plane	The dirt inside the flower pot will be hirizontal and colored brown.
Lanttern	Box	The lanter rectangular form will best match an elongated box.
Shovel	Prism and cylinder 	The handle of the shovel will be a cylinder because it has a round shape and the blade will be a prism because it is flat and angular.
